Password Manager with CLI

Author: MasterSergius <master.sergius@gmail.com>

Description:

Current version uses simplecrypt library, which is secure but very slow.
To use password manager, just run it and type 'help' to get detailed help.
Mail me any bugs or suggestions. Also, you can contribute to this repo
to make this program better.
